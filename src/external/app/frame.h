// The orchestrator (same role as in the AC project): the only place that wires the overlay window, ImGui, game reads
// and the menu together, one frame at a time. Main thread only.
//
// One frame: pump messages (raw input counts key presses) -> follow the game window and focus -> menu key (the
// overlay's hotkey) -> keybinds (poll, bind capture, engine, actions: panic, exit, on / off keys) -> game snapshot
// (every frame while a feature is on, ~4 Hz otherwise) -> aimbot (view angle write) -> triggerbot (attack button
// write) -> ESP, radar, panels -> HUD + menu -> present.
